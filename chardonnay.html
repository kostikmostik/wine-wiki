    <h2>Chardonnay</h2>
    <p> Chardonnay is a green-skinned grape variety used in the production of white wine. 
        The variety originated in the Burgundy wine region of eastern France, but is now grown wherever wine is produced,
         from England to New Zealand. For new and developing wine regions, growing Chardonnay is seen as a 'rite of passage'
         and an easy entry into the international wine market. Chardonnay wine tends to be medium to light body with noticeable 
         acidity and flavors of green plum, apple, and pear. In warmer locations the flavors become more citrus, peach, and
         melon, while in very warm locations (such as the Central Coast AVA of California), more fig and tropical fruit notes
         such as banana and mango come out.
